## Getting started
Checkout our [getting started guide](https://github.com/Pixura/pixura-docs/blob/master/getting-started.md) for an overview of the platform and how to get started building NFT applications. 

### Issuing tokens
Take a look at this example for [deploying a contract](https://github.com/Pixura/pixura-docs/blob/master/examples/javascript/createNFTContract.js) and this one for [issuing tokens](https://github.com/Pixura/pixura-docs/blob/master/examples/javascript/createNFT.js). 

### Building a marketplace
There is a peer 2 peer marketplace for exchanging and trading NFTs deployed [here](https://ropsten.etherscan.io/address/0x5ab0bc9fb287f1aab5e8a6724b5020317100d721). Currently all orders and prices are stored onchain. The next iteration of the marketplace will include infrastructure for offchain orders.

### Querying specific NFT smart contract data
You can run queries over indexed smart contracts with simple GraphQL queries. Try out the interactive [GraphQL API here](https://ropsten-api.pixura.io/graphiql).

### Searching NFT metadata
Users can search through NFT metadata with Elasticsearch. We have a sample [react component](https://github.com/Pixura/pixura-react-sdk) that shows you how the API works.
