## Getting started
Checkout our [getting started guide](https://github.com/Pixura/pixura-docs/blob/master/getting-started.md) for an overview of the platform and how to get started building NFT applications. 

### Issuing tokens
Take a look at this example for [deploying a contract](https://github.com/Pixura/pixura-docs/blob/master/examples/javascript/createNFTContract.js) and this one for [issuing tokens](https://github.com/Pixura/pixura-docs/blob/master/examples/javascript/createNFT.js). 

### Indexing your smart contract
To get your smart contract data indexed by the API take a look at registering the contract address with the API here.

### Building a marketplace
There is a peer 2 peer marketplace for exchanging and trading NFTs deployed here. Currently all orders and prices are stored onchain. The next iteration of the marketplace will include infrastructure for offchain orders.

### Querying specific NFT smart contract data
You can run queries over indexed smart contracts with simple GraphQL queries. Take a look at this example here.

### Searching NFT metadata
Users can search through NFT metadata with Elasticsearch. We have a sample react component that shows you how the API works.
